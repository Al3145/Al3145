- 👋 Hi, I’m Al
- 👋 I’m interested in everything to do with automation and computer graphics.  I hold a fascination with compilers and minimialistic virtual machines. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning raytracing and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to do with automation and compilers.
- 👋 Fun fact: I used to mime and puppeteer :)
